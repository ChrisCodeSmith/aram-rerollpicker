# Aram Rerollpicker

This software is using pyscreeze to find occurances of LoL champions in the LoL Client. It is not harming the client or reading the memory. It just takes screenshots and compares them to a needleimage hold in the champions folder.
To add a champion, just copy your image to the champions folder. Currently the script only takes the first 3 champions, therefore it is adviced not to put more than 3 png files into the folder.
